Subject: Saw your review - how does less returns sound?

Hey there!

I found your store from the review you left on Trendsi,

I'm reaching out because I've built a tool that lets users try on any item of clothing virtually without leaving your store - think a virtual dressing room on your website.

People who try on clothes in high street retails stores are around 40% less likely to return them - I'm convinced that my tool can have a similar effect for Shopify stores.

I'm looking for the first store to pilot my tool, in exchange for a feedback - is this something you would be open to discussing?

Best regards,
